# TASK 3
A hub operates at the physical layer called Layer 1 of the OSI model and broadcasts incoming data to all connected devices regardless of the intended destinations. It does not have MAC Address learning , has a single collision domain and works only in half-duplex mode, It has low performance and low security because every device recieves all traffic.

Switch operates at the data link layer called Layer 2 of teh OSi and forwards data only to the specific destination port by learning MAC Addresses. Each switch port has its own collision domain, and supports full duplex-communication, and it makes better bandwith utilization and higher performance and improved security
